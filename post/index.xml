      <description>I hope to use this blog as a means of sharing and learning all things infosec.
The main topics of the blog will (probably) be related to binary exploitation, pentesting and Windows internals.
Thanks for checking it out.
Feel free to mail me if you have any question or other inquires @ Rallem46123@gmail.com</description>
